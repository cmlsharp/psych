phrenology|Theory that skull shape determined behaviors
neurons|Building blocks of nervous system
sensory neurons|Neurons that carry messages from the tissues to the brain
motor neurons|Neurons that instruct the body to move
dendrite|Part of the nerve cell that receives signals
axon|Part of nerve cell that sends signals
myelin sheathe|Fatty tissue that insulates electrical nerve signals
action potential|Brief electrical charge sent by the nerve cell as a response to stimulus
synapse|Meeting point between two neurons
neurotransmitters|Chemicals released by neurons
reuptake|Nerve cell reabsorbes the excess neurotransmitters
nervous system|Electrochemical network in the body
somatic nervous system|Enables voluntary control of skeletal muscles
autonomic nervous system|Controls glands and the muscles in our internal organs
sympathetic nervous system|Arouses and expends energy
parasympathetic nervous system|Conserves energy and calms you down
reflexes|Automatic response to stimuli
lesion|Scientists sometimes damage parts of the brain intentionally to study the effects
EEG|an amplified readout of brain waves
PET scan|Scan that depicts brain activity based upon its consumption of fuel
MRI|Aligns spinning hydrogen atoms in the brain, maps them as they return to their original location after disruption
fMRI|Shows where blood flows in the brain
brainstem|Oldest region of the brain, where spinal cord swells as it enters the skull
medulla|Along with brainstem, controls heart rate, breathing etc.
pons|Just above the medulla, helps coordinate movement
reticular formation|Finger shaped network of neurons that extends from the spinal cord to the thalmus. Filters incoming stimuli and relays important information to other areas of the brain. Involved in arousal.
thalamus|Sits atop the brainstem, acts as the brain's sensory switchboard
cerebellum|Nonverbal learning, memory, time, modulate emotions, coordinates voluntary movement
limbic system|Between brain's older parts and cerebral hemispheres
amygdala| Influences aggression and fear
hypothalmus|Influences hunger, thirst, body temperature, arousal, pleasureable reward
cerebral cortex|Thin surface layer atop the brain of interconnected nerve cells, ultimate control and processing center
gilial cells|Provide nutrients and insulating myelin to nerve cells
frontal lobes|Just behind the forehead. Involved in speaking, muscle movements, making plans and making judgements
parietal lobes|Lying atop the head towards the rear. Receives sensory input for touch and body position.
occipital lobes|At the back of the head, receives information in the visual field. 
temporal lobes|Roughly above the ears. Includes auditory areas.
motor cortex|At the rear of the frontal lobes, controls voluntary movements
sensory cortex|Area at the front of the parietal lobes that registers and processes body touch and movement sensations
neurogenesis|The formation of new brain cells.
corpus callosum|Large band of neural fibers connecting the two brain hemispheres
split brain|Condition resulting from brain surgery that isolates the brain's two hemispheres
